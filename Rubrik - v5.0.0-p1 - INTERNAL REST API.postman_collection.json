This endpoint 'rolls back' the\n   recovered virtual machine's datastore from the Rubrik cluster to the\n   original datastore.\n * Added `owner` and `status` fields to the `EmailSubscriptionSummary`\n   object used in responses for many `/report/{id}/email_subscription`\n   and `/report/email_subscription/{subscription_id}` endpoints.\n * Added `availableSpace` and `readerLocationSummary` fields to the\n   `NfsLocationDetail` object used in responses for `/archive/nfs` and\n   `/archive/nfs/{id}` endpoints.\n * Added `availableSpace` and `readerLocationSummary` fields to the\n   `QstarLocationSummary` object used in responses for the `/archive/qstar`\n   endpoint.\n * Added `availableSpace` and `readerLocationSummary` fields to the\n   `QstarLocationDetail` object used in responses for the `/archive/qstar/{id}`\n   endpoint.\n * Added `readerLocationSummary` field to the `ObjectStoreLocationDetail`\n   object used in responses for the `/archive/object_store` and\n   `/archive/object_store/{id}` endpoints.\n * Added `readerLocationSummary` field to the `DcaLocationDetail` object\n   used in responses for the `/archive/dca` and `/archive/dca/{id}` endpoints.\n * Added a new field `guestOsType` to `HypervVirtualMachineDetail`\n   object used in response of `GET /hyperv/vm/{id}`\n * Added a new field `guestOsType` to `VirtualMachineDetail`\n   object referred by `VappVmDetail`\n * Added new field `fileType` in response of `/mssql/db/{id}/restore_files`.\n * Added an optional field `agentStatus` to `VirtualMachineSummary` object used\n   in response of `GET /vmware/vm` endpoint. This allows user to check the\n   Rubrik Backup Service connection status of the corresponding VMware VM.\n * Introduced the new `POST /fileset/snapshot/{id}/export_files` endpoint to\n   export multiple files or directories to destination host.\n * Introduced the new `GET /vmware/config/esx_subnets` endpoint to get the\n   the preferred subnets to reach ESX hosts.\n * Introduced the new `PATCH /vmware/config/reset_esx_subnets` endpoint to\n   reset the preferred subnets to reach ESX hosts.\n * Changed the `PATCH /vmware/config/reset_esx_subnets` endpoint to\n   `PATCH /vmware/config/set_esx_subnets`\n * Removed the `needsInspection` field from the NodeStatus object returned in\n   the `/cluster/{id}/node` and `/node` endpoints.\n * Introduced the new `PATCH /auth_domain/{id}` endpoint to update the Active\n   Directory configuration parameters.\n * Introduced the new `GET /cluster/{id}/auto_removed_node` endpoint to\n   query for unacknowledged automatic node removals by the Rubrik cluster.\n * Introduced the new\n   `DELETE /cluster/{id}/auto_removed_node/{node_id}/acknowledge` endpoint to\n   acknowledge an automatic node removal.\n * Introduced the new `GET /cluster/{id}/system_status` endpoint to retrieve\n   information about the status of the Rubrik cluster.\n * Changed the `POST /cloud_on/azure/subscription` endpoint to to take\n   the parameter `AzureSubscriptionRequest` instead of\n   `AzureSubscriptionCredential` in body.\n * Changed the `POST /cloud_on/azure/storage_account` endpoint to to take\n   the parameter `AzureStorageAccountRequest` instead of\n   `AzureStorageAccountCredential` in body.\n * Changed the `POST /cloud_on/azure/resource_group` endpoint to take\n   the parameter `AzureResourceGroupRequest` instead of\n   `AzureResourceGroupCredential` in body.\n * Added a `reportTemplate` field to the response of both the\n   `GET /report/{id}/table` and `GET /report/{id}/chart` endpoints.\n\n ### Changes to Internal API in Rubrik version 4.1\n ## Changes to support instance from image\n * POST /aws/instance and /azure/instance was supported only from a Rubrik\n   snapshot. Now it is changed to support instantiation from Rubrik snapshot as\n   well as pre-existing image. Rest end point is same, we just changed the\n   CreateCloudInstanceRequest object type.\n * Add a new field 'ignoreErrors' to POST /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/restore_files\n   that will let job restore ignore file errors during restore job.\n ## Breaking changes:\n * None is removed as a Nutanix snapshot consistency mandate so it is no\n   longer valid in GET /nutanix/vm, GET /nutanix/vm/{id}, and\n   PATCH /nutanix/vm/{id}.\n * computeSecurityGroupId is replaced by the object defaultComputeNetworkConfig\n   in ObjectStoreLocationSummary ,ObjectStoreUpdateDefinition and\n   ObjectStoreReconnectDefinition which are used by\n   GET /archive/object_store/{id}, PATCH /archive/object_store/{id} and\n   POST /archive/object_store/reconnect respectively.\n * The PUT /throttle endpoint was changed to provide configuration for\n   Hyper-V adaptive throttling. Three parameters were added:\n   hypervHostIoLatencyThreshold, hypervHostCpuUtilizationThreshold, and\n   hypervVmCpuUtilizationThreshold. To differentiate between the multiple\n   hypervisors, the existing configuration parameters for VMware were renamed\n   VmwareVmIoLatencyThreshold, VmwareDatastoreIoLatencyThreshold and\n   VmwareCpuUtilizationThreshold. These changes also required modifications\n   and additions to the GET /throttle endpoint.\n * For `POST /cluster/{id}/node` endpoint, it gets now `AddNodesConfig` in body\n   instead of `Map_NodeConfig` directly.\n * For `POST /node_management/replace_node` endpoint, added the `ipmiPassword`\n   field to the `ReplaceNodeConfig` object.\n * For `POST /stats/system_storage` endpoint, added the miscellaneous, liveMount\n   and snapshot field to `SystemStorageStats` object.\n * For `POST /principal_search`, removed `managedId` field from the\n   `PrincipalSummary` object and changed the `id` field of the\n   `PrincipalSummary` object to correspond to the managed id instead of the\n   simple id.\n * For `GET /cluster/{id}/timezone` and `PATCH /cluster/{id}/timezone`, the\n   functionality has merged into `GET /cluster/{id}` and `PATCH /cluster/{id}`\n   in v1.\n * Removed the `GET /cluster/{id}/decommissionNodeStatus` endpoint.\n   Decommission status is now available through queries of the `jobId` that is\n   returned by a decommission request. Queries can be performed at the\n   `GET /job/{id}` endpoint.\n * For `GET /api/internal/managed_volume/?name=<name>`, the name match is now\n   exact instead of infix\n * Updated the list of available attribute and measure values for the `chart0`\n   and `chart1` parameters for the `PATCH /report/{id}` endpoint.\n * Updated the list of available column values for the `table` parameter for the\n   `PATCH /report/{id}` endpoint.\n * Updated the `FolderHierarchy` response object to include\n   `effectiveSlaDomainId`, `effectiveSlaDomainName`,\n   `effectiveSlaSourceObjectId`, and `effectiveSlaSourceObjectName`.\n\n ## Feature Additions/improvements:\n * Added the field `pendingSnapshotCount` to ManagedVolumeSummary and\n   ManagedVolumeDetail objects used in responses for endpoints\n   `GET /managed_volume`, `POST /managed_volume`, `GET /managed_volume/{id}`,\n   `PATCH /managed_volume/{id}`, `GET /organization/{id}/managed_volume`.\n * Introduced the `GET /managed_volume/snapshot/export/{id}` endpoint\n   to retrieve details of a specific managed volume snapshot export.\n * Added the 'name' filter for GET requests on the /replication/target endpoint.\n   This filter allows users to filter results based on the name of a\n   replication target.\n * Added the 'name' filter for GET requests on the /archive/location endpoint.\n   This filter allows users to filter results based on the name of an\n   archival location.\n * Added new fields 'replicas' and 'availabilityGroupId' on GET /mssql\n   and GET /mssql/{id}. If a database is an availability database,\n   it will have some number of replicas, which are copies of the database\n   running on different instances. Otherwise, there will only be one\n   replica, which represents the single copy of the database. The field\n   'availabilityGroupId' will be set only for availability databases\n   and points to the availability group of the database. Also deprecated\n   several fields on these endpoints, as they should now be accessed via\n   the 'replicas' field.\n * Added 'Cluster' notification type.\n * Added optional 'organizationId' parameter to to the grant/revoke and get\n  authorization endpoints. This parameter can be used to\n   grant/revoke/get authorizations with respect to a specific Organization.\n * Added endpoint to get/set whether the Rubrik Backup Service is automatically\n   deployed to a guest OS.\n * Added cloudInstantiationSpec field to Hyper-V VM endpoint for configuring\n   automatic cloud conversion\n * Introduced a new end point /cluster/{id}/platforminfo to GET information\n   about the platform the current software is running on\n * Introduced the `GET /organization` and `GET /organization/{id}` endpoints\n   for retrieving the list of organizations and a single organization.\n * Introduced the `POST /organization` endpoint for creating organizations,\n   the `PATCH /organization/{id}` endpoint for updating organizations and the\n   `DELETE /organization/{id}` endpoint for deleting organizations.\n * Introduced the `GET /organization/{id}/stats/storage_growth_timeseries`\n   endpoint and the `GET /organization/{id}/stats/total_storage_usage` for\n   getting Physical Storage Growth over Time and Total Physical Storage Usage\n   on a per Organization basis.\n * Introduced a number of endpoints of the format\n   `GET /organization/{id}/<resource-type>` for retrieving all the resources of\n   the corresponding type in a given organization.\n * Introduced a number of endpoints of the format\n   `GET /organization/{id}/<resource-type>/metric` for retrieving the protection\n   counts of the resources of the corresponding type in a given organization.\n * Added the 'reportTemplate' filter for GET requests on the /report endpoint.\n   This allows queried reports to be filtered and sorted by report template.\n * Introduced the `POST /cluster/{id}/security/password/strength` endpoint\n   for assessing the strength of passwords during bootstrap through rkcli.\n * Added a new 'ipv6' field in the response of the `GET /cluster/{id}/discover`\n   endpoint.\n * Added relatedIds field for EventSummary object to give more context about\n   the event.\n * Added operatingSystemType field for NutanixSummary object. This field\n   represents the type of operating system on the Nutanix virtual machine.\n\n ### Changes to Internal API in Rubrik version 4.0\n ## Breaking changes:\n * For `GET /unmanaged_object` endpoint, replaced the 'Fileset' of object_type\n   filter with more specific object types: 'WindowsFileset', 'LinuxFileset' and\n   'ShareFileset'. Also added filter value for additional unmanaged objects\n   we now support.\n * For /mssql/db/{id}/compatible_instance added recoveryType as mandatory\n   query parameter\n\n ## Feature Additions/improvements:\n * Added QStar end points to support it as an archival location. The location\n   is always encrypted and an encryption password must be set while adding the\n   location. End points added:\n   - `DELETE /archive/qstar` to clean up the data in the bucket in the QStar\n     archival location.\n   - `GET /archive/qstar` to retrieve a summary of all QStar archival locations.\n   - `POST /archive/qstar` to add a QStar archival location.\n   - `POST /archive/qstar/reconnect` to reconnect to a specific QStar archival\n     location.\n   - `POST /archive/qstar/remove_bucket` to remove buckets matching a prefix\n      from QStar archival location.\n   - `GET /archive/qstar/{id}` to retrieve a summary information from a specific\n     QStar archival location.\n   - `PATCH /archive/qstar/{id}` to update a specific QStar archival location.\n * Added the 'name' filter for GET requests on the /archive/location endpoint.\n   This filter allows users to filter results based on the name of an\n   archival location.\n * Introduced an optional parameter `encryptionPassword` for the\n   `/data_location/nfs` `POST` endpoint. This password is used for\n   deriving the master key for encrypting the NFS archival location.\n * Introduced /managed\\_volume, /managed\\_volume/snapshot/export/{id},\n   and other child endpoints for creating, deleting, and updating\n   Managed Volumes and its exports and snapshots.\n * Added support for Hyper-V.\n * Add new /hierarchy endpoint to support universal hierarchy view.\n * Added support for Nutanix.\n * Moved and merged vCenter refresh status and delete status from independent\n   internal endpoints to a single status field in v1 vCenter detail.\n * Added endpoint to get/set whether the Rubrik Backup Service is automatically\n   deployed to a guest OS.\n * Introduced an optional parameter `minTolerableNodeFailures` for the\n   `/cluster/decommissionNode` `POST` endpoint. This parameter specifies the\n   minimum fault tolerance to node failures that must exist when a node is\n   decommissioned.\n * Added `nodeId` to `AsyncRequestStatus` to improve debugging job failures.\n\n ### Changes to Internal API in Rubrik version 3.2.0\n ## Breaking changes:\n * Introduced endpoint /host/share/id/search to search for\n   files on the network share.\n * Introduced endpoints /host/share and /host/share/id to\n   support native network shares under /host endpoint.\n * For /unmanaged_object endpoints, change sort_attr to sort_by\n   sort_attr used to accept a comma separated list of column names to sort.\n   Now sort_by only accepts a single column name.\n * For /unmanaged_object endpoints, removed the need for object type when\n   deleting unmanaged objects and its snapshots.\n\n ## Feature Additions/improvements:\n * Added internal local_<component> end points. These are used for\n   handling operations on per-node auto-scaling config values.\n   Please see src/spec/local-config/comments for details.\n * For the response of /mssql/db/{id}/restore_files, added two more fields\n   for each file object. They are the original file name and file length\n   of the file to be restore.\n * Introduced a new end point /cluster/{id}/is_registered to GET registration\n   status. With this change, we can query if the cluster is registered in the\n   Rubrik customer database.\n * Introduced a new end point /cluster/{id}/registration_details to POST\n   registration details. Customers are expected to get the registration details\n   from the support portal. On successful submission of registration details\n   with a valid registration id, the cluster will mark itself as registered.\n * For the /mssql/instance/{id} end point, added fields configuredSlaDomainId,\n   configuredSlaDomainName, logBackupFrequencyInSeconds, logRetentionHours,\n   and copyOnly.\n * Introduced optional parameter keepMacAddresses to\n   POST /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/mount, /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/export, and\n   /vmware/vm/snapshot/{id}/instant_recovery endpints.\n   This allows new VMs to have the same MAC address as their source VMs.\n\n ## Bug fixes:\n * Made path parameter required in GET /browse. Previously, an error was\n   thrown when path wasn't passed in. This solves that bug.\n",
